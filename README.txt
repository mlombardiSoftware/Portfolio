Welcome to Michael Lombardi's Portfolio!
This is a collection of coding challenges done in various languages to show my coding style and proficiency.

In these challenges I use my natural coding style:
For communication, I write few comments, but instead use thorough documentation as well as clear function and variable names.
For organization, I write many short functions, so that each function is coherent and reusable.
For style, I use tabs and write opening braces on their own line.
These are just my personal preferences and I can adapt to whatever style is required.
